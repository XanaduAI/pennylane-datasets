# Arginine Radical

The Arginine radical (*C₄H₉N₃*), also known as its **side chain**, is a complex and highly polar structure that defines the unique chemical behavior of arginine. It consists of a **three-carbon aliphatic chain** ending in a **guanidinium group (–C(NH)(NH₂)₂)**, which is strongly **positively charged** at physiological pH. This makes the radical **highly hydrophilic** and capable of forming multiple **hydrogen bonds** and **ionic interactions**. Along with the **amino (–NH₂)** and **carboxyl (–COOH)** groups, the C₄H₉N₃ radical completes arginine’s structure, contributing to its critical roles in **metabolism**, **structural stability**, and **biological regulation**.

## Using this dataset

This dataset contains various quantum properties that represent and describe the arginine radical under certain conditions.  The dataset includes molecular geometries, the Hamiltonian, energies, and other descriptors that can be used to analyze the molecule’s behavior and to built up the entire arginine amino acid.

Key features include:

- Molecular information (name, molecular formula, charge, spin, geometry etc.)
- Resource estimation (number of atoms, electrons, orbitals, qubits and hamiltonian coefficients to represent the molecule)
- Jordan-Wigner Hamiltonian representation
- Approximations to the ground state energy

This dataset is intended to:

- Facilitate research on relevant organic molecules by providing crucial yet computationally expensive properties—such as ground state energy and the molecular Hamiltonian—thereby accelerating advancements in quantum simulations of biomolecules.

- Enhance the characterization of larger biomolecular systems by bridging the gap between existing datasets, which are primarily focused on small molecules, and the needs of researchers working on peptides and proteins.

- Support hybrid QM/ML approaches, allowing researchers to train models that accurately and efficiently predict the properties of larger and more complex systems.

- Accelerate drug discovery and biomolecular research, as proteins are central to numerous biological and therapeutic processes.

- Enable the study of fragmentation and reassembly techniques by proposing new chemical corrections for bond formation and ensuring accurate reconstruction of molecular properties after simulation, in line with the results obtained in our latest work.
