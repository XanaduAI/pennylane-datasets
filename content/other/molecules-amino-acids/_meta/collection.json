    "description": "The dataset includes 45 molecules, covering the 20 essential amino acids found in the human body, along with their fundamental substructures: the amino terminal group, carboxyl terminal group, alpha carbon, and the 20 unique side chains that define them. Comprising predominantly organic molecules with up to 15 non-hydrogen atoms (C, N, O, S), QMProt provides detailed physical and chemical properties, as well as important quantum properties, including the corresponding Hamiltonian and ground state energy. A total of 45 molecules is given.",
