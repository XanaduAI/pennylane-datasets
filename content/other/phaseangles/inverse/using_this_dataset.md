This dataset provides two types of data. First, it includes a polynomial  P(x)  that approximates the function  f(x) = \frac{\kappa}{2x}  over the interval  [-1, -1/\kappa) \cup (1/\kappa, 1]  with a maximum error of  \epsilon . In this dataset,  \kappa  can take values from the set \{1, 5, 50, 100, 250,500,1000,1500\}, and its choice depends on the specific interval in which we aim to approximate the function. Additionally,  \epsilon  represents the maximum error between the polynomial  P(x)  and the function  f(x)  over the chosen interval, with predefined values of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001.
Furthermore,  P(x)  is expressed in the Chebyshev basis and can be accessed via data_dict['poly_cheb']. This returns an array where, for example, [1, 0, 2] corresponds to the polynomial  1 \cdot T_0(x) + 0 \cdot T_1(x) + 2 \cdot T_2(x) , where  T_n(x)  denotes the  n -th Chebyshev polynomial.
Additionally, the dataset provides the phase angles required for the QSP and QSVT subroutines, which implement the polynomial transformation  P(x) . These angles can be accessed by specifying the routine as either "qsp" or "qsvt".

**Additional details**

- The kappas are between value a and value b
- The epsilons are between value c and value d
- Something else?

**Example usage**
Would be good to have an example here that shows the phase angles are correct.
```python
[ds] = qml.data.load("other", name="inverse")

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(basis_state):
    qml.QSVT(ds.angles['QSVT'])
    return qml.expval(qml.Z(0))
```
