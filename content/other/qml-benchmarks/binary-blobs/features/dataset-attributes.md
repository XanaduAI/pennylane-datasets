|`train`|`dict`|Train data `train['inputs']` and labels `train['labels']`. Each input is a binary array of shape (16,) that when reshaped to shape (4,4) gives a 2D image corresponding to one of 8 patterns. Labels are integers from 0 to 7 specifying the pattern of the corresponding input.|
|`test`|`dict`|Test data `test['inputs']` and labels `test['labels']`. Each input is a binary array of shape (16,) that when reshaped to shape (4,4) gives a 2D image corresponding to one of 8 patterns. Labels are integers from 0 to 7 specifying the pattern of the corresponding input.|
