The subtle art of benchmarking quantum machine learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07059) and [Train on classical, deploy on quantum: scaling generative quantum machine learning to a thousand qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02934). These datasets offer several classification tasks that can be used for benchmarking quantum machine learning models.",
