This dataset contains various quantum properties that represent and describe the H10 molecule with a specific [bond length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_length).

Key features include:

- Jordan-Wigner Hamiltonian representation
- [Molecule geometry information](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry)
- [Givens rotations-based](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_givens_rotations) ansatz with optimal parameters for VQE

It can be used to:

- Explore and develop new quantum chemistry algorithms 
- Benchmark or test number of resources and accuracy
- Quantum machine learning applications
