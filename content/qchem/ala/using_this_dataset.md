This dataset contains various quantum properties that represent and describe the C3H7NO2 molecule with different sto-3g basis sets and 0.98102 bond lengths.
Key features include:
* Jordan-Wigner Hamiltonian representation
* Molecule geometry information
* Qubit-wise commuting groups for hardware measurements, including simulated output samples
* Givens rotations-based ansatz with optimal parameters for VQE
* Approximations to the ground state of varying quality, from exact to 0.1% overlap
It can be used to:
* Explore and develop new quantum chemistry algorithms
* Benchmark or test number of resources and accuracy
* Quantum machine learning applications
* Investigate the dependence of algorithm performance on initial state quality
